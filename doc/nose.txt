Running test written for nose
=======================================

.. include:: links.inc

py.test has basic support for running tests written for nose_.
This is implemented in :pymod:`pytest.plugin.nose`.

Usage
-------------

type::

    py.test  # instead of 'nosetests'

and you should be able to run your nose style tests and at the same
make full use of py.test's capabilities.

Supported nose Idioms
----------------------

* setup and teardown at module/class/method level
* SkipTest exceptions and markers
* setup/teardown decorators
* yield-based tests and their setup
* general usage of nose utilities

Unsupported idioms / issues
----------------------------------

- nose-style doctests are not collected and executed correctly,
  also fixtures don't work.

- no nose-configuration is recognized

If you find other issues or have suggestions please run::

    py.test --pastebin=all

and send the resulting URL to a py.test contact channel,
at best to the mailing list.
