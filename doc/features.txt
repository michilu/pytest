py.test Features
==================

no-boilerplate testing with Python
----------------------------------

- automatic, fully customizable Python test discovery
- allows fully :pep:`8` compliant coding style
- write simple test functions and freely group tests
- ``assert`` statement for your assertions
- powerful parametrization of test functions
- rely on powerful traceback and assertion reporting
- use ``print`` or ``pdb`` debugging on failures

extensive plugin and customization system
------------------------------------------------------

.. _`suprisingly easy`: http://bruynooghe.blogspot.com/2009/12/skipping-slow-test-by-default-in-pytest.html

- all collection, reporting, running aspects are delegated to hook functions
- hook functions are defined per-directory, per-project or through PyPI released plugins
- it is `suprisingly easy`_ to add command line options or
  do other kind of add-ons and customizations.

mature command line testing tool
--------------------------------------

- powerful :ref:`usage` possibilities
- used in many projects, ranging from 10 to 10K tests
- simple well sorted command line options
- runs on Unix, Windows from Python 2.4 up to Python 3.1 and 3.2
- is itself tested extensively on a CI server
- keyword/testname based selection of tests

integrates well with CI systems
----------------------------------------

- produces compatible JunitXML output for Hudson or other CI servers
- produces "resultlog" text files for easy parsing
- integrates well with tox_

supports several testing practises and methods
-----------------------------------------------------------

- supports extended `xUnit style setup`_
- can integrate nose_, `unittest.py` and `doctest.py`_ style tests
- supports generating testing coverage reports
- supports :ref:`non-python tests`
- `Javasript unit- and functional testing`_

.. _`coverage testing with figleaf`: plugin/figleaf.html
.. _`unittest.py`: http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html

distributing tests to local/remote subprocesses
--------------------------------------------------------

.. _`pytest-xdist`: plugin/xdist.html

- distribute tests to multiple CPUs
- distribute tests to remote ssh or socket connected machines
- run tests in subprocess, re-run failing ones on file-change

skip or expect-to-fail a test
-------------------------------------------

- skip tests if there are platform or dependency mismatches
- xfail a test (on certain platforms)indicating an implementation problem
- you can use skip and xfail imperatively or as a decorating marker
