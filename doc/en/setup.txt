Page has moved to fixture
========================================================

During development prior to the pytest-2.3 release the name
``pytest.setup`` was used but before the release it was renamed
to :ref:`pytest.fixture` mainly to avoid the misconception that there 
should be a ``pytest.teardown`` as well. 

Please refer to :ref:`pytest.fixture` for information on the new
fixture functions.
