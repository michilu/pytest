pytest-2.3: generalized fixtures/funcarg mechanism
=============================================================================

pytest is a popular tool for writing automated tests in Python. Version
2.3 comes with several innovations for writing test fixtures -- 
needed to provide a fixed base state or preinitialized objects 
for your tests.  For info and tutorial-style examples, see

    http://pytest.org/dev/fixture.html

All changes are backward compatible and you should be able to continue
to run your existing test suites.   In particular, dependency-injected
"funcargs" still form the base of the improved fixture system but it is
now easy to create parametrized funcargs/fixtures or cache them across
modules or test sessions.  Moreover, there is now support for using
pytest fixtures with unittest-style suites, see here for example:

    http://pytest.org/dev/unittest.html

If you are interested in the precise reasoning of the pytest-2.3 fixture
evolution, please consult http://pytest.org/dev/funcarg_compare.html

and more details for those already in the knowing of pytest can be found
in the CHANGELOG below.

Particular thanks for this release go to Floris Bruynooghe, Alex Okrushko
Carl Meyer, Ronny Pfannschmidt, Benjamin Peterson and Alex Gaynor for helping 
to get the new features right and well integrated.  Ronny and Floris
also helped to fix a number of bugs and yet more people helped by
providing bug reports.

have fun,
