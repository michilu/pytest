py.test 2.0.0: improved asserts, unittest, reporting, config, docs
===========================================================================

Welcome to pytest-2.0.0, a major new release of "py.test", the rapid
easy Python testing tool.  There are many new features and enhancements,
see below.  Also a lot of long-deprecated code has been removed,
resulting in a much smaller and cleaner implementation.   Note that
pytest used to part of the "py" distribution up until version py-1.3.4
but this has changed now:  pytest-2.0.0 only contains py.test related
code and is expected to be backward-compatible to existing test code. If
you want to install it, type one of::

    pip install -U pytest
    easy_install -U pytest

and check out the much improved documentation and examples:

    http://pytest.org/2.0.0/index.html

Thanks to all issue reporters and people asking questions or
complaining.  Particular thanks to Floris Bruynooghe and Ronny Pfannschmidt
for their great coding contributions and may others for feedback and help.

best,
holger krekel


New Features
-----------------------

- new invocations through Python interpreter and from Python::

    python -m pytest      # on all pythons >= 2.5

  or from a python program::

    import pytest ; pytest.main(arglist, pluginlist)

  see http://pytest.org/2.0.0/usage.html for details.

- new and better reporting information in assert expressions
  if comparing lists, sequences or strings.

  see http://pytest.org/2.0.0/assert.html for details.

- new configuration through ini-files (setup.cfg or tox.ini recognized),
  for example::

    [pytest]
    norecursedirs = .hg data*  # don't ever recurse in such dirs
    addopts = -x --pyargs      # add these command line options by default

  see http://pytest.org/2.0.0/customize.html

- improved standard unittest support.  In general py.test should now
  better run custom TestCases like twisted trial or Django based
  TestCases.  Also you can now run the tests of an installed
  'unittest' package with py.test::

    py.test --pyargs unittest

- new "-q" option which decreases verbosity and prints a more
  nose/unittest-style "dot" output.

- many more improvements in details

Fixes
-----------------------

- fix issue126 - introduce py.test.set_trace() to trace execution via
  PDB during the running of tests even if capturing is ongoing.
- fix issue124 - make reporting more resilient against tests opening
  files on filedescriptor 1 (stdout).
- fix issue109 - sibling conftest.py files will not be loaded.
  (and Directory collectors cannot be customized anymore from a Directory's
  conftest.py - this needs to happen at least one level up).
- fix issue88 (finding custom test nodes from command line arg)
- fix issue93 stdout/stderr is captured while importing conftest.py
- fix bug: unittest collected functions now also can have "pytestmark"
  applied at class/module level

Notes
--------------------

* The usual way in pre-2.0 times to use py.test in python code was
  to import "py" and then e.g. use "py.test.raises" for the helper.
  This remains valid and is not planned to be deprecated.  However,
  in most examples and internal code you'll find "import pytest"
  and "pytest.raises" used as the recommended default way.

* pytest now first performs collection of the complete test suite
  before running any test. This changes for example the semantics of when
  pytest_collectstart/pytest_collectreport are called.  Some plugins may
  need upgrading.

* The pytest package consists of a 400 LOC core.py and about 20 builtin plugins,
  summing up to roughly 5000 LOCs, including docstrings. To be fair, it also
  uses generic code from the "pylib", and the new "py" package to help
  with filesystem and introspection/code manipulation.

(Incompatible) Removals
-----------------------------

- py.test.config is now only available if you are in a test run.

- the following (mostly already deprecated) functionality was removed:

  - removed support for Module/Class/... collection node definitions
    in conftest.py files.  They will cause nothing special.
  - removed support for calling the pre-1.0 collection API of "run()" and "join"
  - removed reading option values from conftest.py files or env variables.
    This can now be done much much better and easier through the ini-file
    mechanism and the "addopts" entry in particular.
  - removed the "disabled" attribute in test classes.  Use the skipping
    and pytestmark mechanism to skip or xfail a test class.

- py.test.collect.Directory does not exist anymore and it
  is not possible to provide an own "Directory" object.
  If you have used this and don't know what to do, get
  in contact.  We'll figure someting out.

  Note that pytest_collect_directory() is still called but
  any return value will be ignored.  This allows to keep
  old code working that performed for example "py.test.skip()"
  in collect() to prevent recursion into directory trees
  if a certain dependency or command line option is missing.


More Detailed Changes between 1.3.4 and 2.0.0
==================================================

- pytest-2.0 is now its own package and depends on pylib-2.0
- new ability: python -m pytest / python -m pytest.main ability
- new python invcation: pytest.main(args, plugins) to load
  some custom plugins early.
- try harder to run unittest test suites in a more compatible manner
  by deferring setup/teardown semantics to the unittest package.
- introduce a new way to set config options via ini-style files,
  by default setup.cfg and tox.ini files are searched.  The old
  ways (certain environment variables, dynamic conftest.py reading
  is removed).
- add a new "-q" option which decreases verbosity and prints a more
  nose/unittest-style "dot" output.
- fix issue135 - marks now work with unittest test cases as well
- fix issue126 - introduce py.test.set_trace() to trace execution via
  PDB during the running of tests even if capturing is ongoing.
- fix issue123 - new "python -m py.test" invocation for py.test
  (requires Python 2.5 or above)
- fix issue124 - make reporting more resilient against tests opening
  files on filedescriptor 1 (stdout).
- fix issue109 - sibling conftest.py files will not be loaded.
  (and Directory collectors cannot be customized anymore from a Directory's
  conftest.py - this needs to happen at least one level up).
- introduce (customizable) assertion failure representations and enhance
  output on assertion failures for comparisons and other cases (Floris Bruynooghe)
- nose-plugin: pass through type-signature failures in setup/teardown
  functions instead of not calling them (Ed Singleton)
- remove py.test.collect.Directory (follows from a major refactoring
  and simplification of the collection process)
- majorly reduce py.test core code, shift function/python testing to own plugin
- fix issue88 (finding custom test nodes from command line arg)
- refine 'tmpdir' creation, will now create basenames better associated
  with test names (thanks Ronny)
- "xpass" (unexpected pass) tests don't cause exitcode!=0
- fix issue131 / issue60 - importing doctests in __init__ files used as namespace packages
- fix issue93 stdout/stderr is captured while importing conftest.py
- fix bug: unittest collected functions now also can have "pytestmark"
  applied at class/module level
- add ability to use "class" level for cached_setup helper
- fix strangeness: mark.* objects are now immutable, create new instances
