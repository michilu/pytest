py.test 2.0.0: standalone, features++, implementation++, docs++
===========================================================================

XXX PENDING

Welcome to pytest-2.0.0!  With this release py.test becomes its own standalone
PyPI distribution, named ``pytest``, installing the ``py.test`` command line
tool.  Apart from a great internal cleanup this release comes with tons
of improvements and new features and a completely revamped extensive
documentation, including many continously tested examples. See

    http://pytest.org

New Features
-----------------------

- new invocations through Python interpreter and from Python::

    python -m pytest      # on all pythons >= 2.7
    python -m pytest.main # on all pythons >= 2.5
    import pytest ; pytest.main(args, plugins)

  see http://pytest.org/2.0.0/invoke.html for details.

- new configuration through ini-files (setup.cfg or tox.ini recognized),
  for example::

    [pytest]
    norecursedirs = .hg _build
    python_collect_funcprefix = test_
    python_collect_classprefix = Test

  see http://pytest.org/2.0.0/customize.html
