py.test 2.2.0: new test duration profiling and bug fixes
===========================================================================

pytest-2.2.0 is a quite backward compatible release of the popular
py.test testing tool.  It introduces the new "--duration=N" option
showing the N slowest test execution or setup/teardown calls.   The
release also contains a few fixes and some cleanup of pytest's own test
suite allowing it to run on a wider range of environments.

For general information, see extensive docs with examples here:

     http://pytest.org/

If you want to install or upgrade pytest you might just type::

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest

incompatible change
------------------------------------

* You need a new version of the pytest-xdist plugin (1.7) for distributing 
  test runs.  

* Also other plugins might need an upgrade if they implement
  the ``pytest_runtest_logreport`` hook which now is called unconditionally
  for the setup/teardown fixture phases of a test. You can just choose to
  ignore them by inserting "if rep.when != 'call': return". Note that
  most code probably "just" works because the hook was already called
  for failing setup/teardown phases of a test.
