py.test 2.2.0: improved test markers and duration profiling
===========================================================================

pytest-2.2.0 is a quite (*) backward compatible release of the popular
py.test testing tool.  It includes the following new features:

* new "--duration=N" option showing the N slowest test execution 
  or setup/teardown calls.

* new "-m markexpr" option for selecting tests according to their mark

* new ini-variable for registering test markers and a "--strict"
  option that will error out if you are using unregistered markers

Usages of the improved marking mechanism is illustrated by a couple
of initial examples, see XXX

Besides there is the usual set of bug fixes along with a cleanup of
pytest's own test suite allowing it to run on a wider range of environments.

For general information, see extensive docs with examples here:

     http://pytest.org/

If you want to install or upgrade pytest you might just type::

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest


(*) incompatible changes:

* You need a new version of the pytest-xdist plugin (1.7) for distributing 
  test runs.  

* Other plugins might need an upgrade if they implement
  the ``pytest_runtest_logreport`` hook which now is called unconditionally
  for the setup/teardown fixture phases of a test. You can just choose to
  ignore them by inserting "if rep.when != 'call': return". Note that
  most code probably "just" works because the hook was already called
  for failing setup/teardown phases of a test.

Thanks to Ronny Pfannschmidt, David Burns, Jeff Donner, Daniel Nouri, XXX for their
help and feedback on various issues.
