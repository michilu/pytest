collect and run doctests from modules and test files.
=========================================================

By default all files matching the ``test*.txt`` pattern will
be run through the python standard ``doctest`` module.  You
can change the pattern by issuing::

    py.test --doctest-glob='*.rst'

on the command line.  You can also trigger running of doctests
from docstrings in all python modules (including regular
python test modules)::

    py.test --doctest-modules

You can make these changes permanent in your project by
putting them into a conftest.py file like this::

    # content of conftest.py
    option_doctestmodules = True
    option_doctestglob = "*.rst"
