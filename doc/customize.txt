basic test configuration
===================================

Command line options and configuration file settings
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can get help on options and configuration options by running::

    py.test -h   # prints options _and_ config file settings

This will display command line and configuration file settings
which were registered by installed plugins.

how test configuration is read from setup/tox ini-files
--------------------------------------------------------

py.test looks for the first ``[pytest]`` section in either the first ``setup.cfg`` or the first ``tox.ini`` file found upwards from the arguments.  Example::

    py.test path/to/testdir

will look in the following dirs for a config file::

    path/to/testdir/setup.cfg
    path/to/setup.cfg
    path/setup.cfg
    setup.cfg
    ... # up until root of filesystem
    path/to/testdir/tox.ini
    path/to/tox.ini
    path/tox.ini
    ... # up until root of filesystem

If no path was provided at all the current working directory is used for the lookup.

builtin configuration file options
----------------------------------------------

.. confval:: minversion = VERSTRING

   specifies the minimal pytest version that is needed for this test suite.

        minversion = 2.1  # will fail if we run with pytest-2.0

.. confval:: addopts = OPTS

   add the specified ``OPTS`` to the set of command line arguments as if they
   had been specified by the user. Example: if you have this ini file content::

       [pytest]
       addopts = --maxfail=2 -rf  # exit after 2 failures, report fail info

   issuing ``py.test test_hello.py`` actually means::

       py.test --maxfail=2 -rf test_hello.py
